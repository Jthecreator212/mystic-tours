            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
              Mystic Tours was born from a deep love for Jamaica's rich cultural heritage and a desire to share
              authentic experiences with travelers from around the world.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
              Founded in 1978 by Marcus Johnson, a local musician and cultural ambassador, our company began as a small
              operation taking visitors to off-the-beaten-path music venues and cultural sites that weren't featured in
              typical tourist itineraries.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Over four decades later, we've grown into one of the island's most respected tour operators, but our
              mission remains the same: to connect visitors with the true spirit, rhythm, and soul of Jamaica through
              immersive, authentic experiences.

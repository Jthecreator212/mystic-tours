# Mystic Tours

## Recent Improvements

- **Next.js config consolidated**: All configuration is now in `next.config.mjs`.
- **TypeScript strict mode enabled**: Improved type safety for new code. Existing errors will not block builds.
- **Ready for testing setup**: Jest and React Testing Library can be added for future stability (see below).

---

## Next Steps
- Remove `ignoreBuildErrors` and `ignoreDuringBuilds` after cleaning up existing issues.
- Add automated tests for core components and pages.
